## About Me

> Full-Stack Developer (MERN) and former AWS Certified Cloud Architect Associate Instructor

I am a veteran of the United States Air Force with a Bachelors in Communication Studies from Temple University, Japan Campus.  After living abroad with the Military and my university I returned to the United State and attended a year long coding program in New York City where we learned the LAMP and MERN stacks as well as AWS.  I then was hired at Code Immersives in January 2019 where I taught the final term MERN stack class.  This class concluded with an AWS Cloud Foundations course with I was solely responsible for.  I further developed the class with my own additions to the course.  These additions were to both teach the cloud to the students with no cloud or networking knowledge needed or expected and afterwards to teach them how to deploy their code to the cloud, including a linux server from scratch.  Currently I am studying to achieve my AWS Cloud Architect Proffesional level.
