## About Me

> Full-Stack Developer (MERN) and AWS Cloud Architect Associate Instructor

I am a United States Air Force veteran with a Bachelor's degree in Communication Studies from Temple University's Japan Campus. My experiences living abroad through both military service and academia have shaped my adaptability and global perspective.
Upon returning to the United States, I completed an intensive year-long coding program in New York City, where I gained proficiency in the LAMP and MERN stacks, as well as AWS cloud technologies. In January 2019, I joined Code Immersives—later acquired by CompTIA—as an instructor, leading the final-term MERN stack course. Additionally, I was solely responsible for the AWS Cloud Foundations module, which I further enhanced with custom curriculum additions. My approach emphasized accessibility, ensuring that students with no prior cloud or networking experience could grasp fundamental concepts. Beyond foundational cloud knowledge, I guided students through deploying their applications using AWS services such as S3 and EC2, configuring Linux servers from scratch with NGINX for production readiness
